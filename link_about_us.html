    <h2>How to Stay Healthy: Some Advice</h2>
    <p>Staying strong and healthy requires a balanced approach that combines physical activity, nutrition, and mental wellness. Here are some key tips to help you stay on track:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistency is Key:</strong> Stick to a regular workout routine that includes strength training, cardiovascular exercises, and mobility work. Aim for consistency, not perfection.</li>
        <li><strong>Fuel Your Body:</strong> Eat a well-rounded diet rich in lean proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. Hydration is also crucial—drink plenty of water throughout the day.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest and Recovery:</strong> Sleep is essential for muscle recovery and overall health. Aim for 7-9 hours per night and incorporate rest days into your training.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Realistic Goals:</strong> Set achievable goals and celebrate progress, no matter how small. This keeps you motivated and focused on improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Pay attention to signs of fatigue or pain. Rest when needed and avoid overtraining to prevent injury.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental Wellness:</strong> Stay positive and manage stress through mindfulness practices, social connections, and engaging in activities that bring you joy.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Active Daily:</strong> In addition to your workouts, stay active throughout the day with walks, stretching, or other physical activities to keep your body moving.</li>
